The Beta branch is public on GitHub. Its not complete (90% of recipes are missing) and expect bugs / shenanigans.
Some things aren't fully working, some are invisible (I KNOW KEKW) and others are just a Placeholder.

I suggest to you guys do not use this beta branch on actual worlds, I don't know what can happen, make sure to have backups ready if anything goes to hell.

Informations about the Milking System:
Beefalos, Koalefants, No-Eyed Deers and Ewecuses can be milked using the Bucket. They can only be milked when they're awake, except for Koalefants and Ewecuses that can be milked while sleeping or awake.

When milking, there's a chance the animal will attack the player (70%). This chance is lowered when wearing a Beefalo Hat (10%). They can be milked every 5 in-game Days, except during Spring which becomes 8 in-game Days, but instead, they give 2 units of their Milk. 

You can still use the Beefalo Milk mod without problems, just make sure to use the correct tool. As they have different cooldowns, loots, etc.

Informations about the making of Artisan Products:
The Artisan Products can be produced using the Wooden Keg or the Preserves Jar. They take several days to be done. Some of them have special effects and they do not count towards the Cookbook, instead, they can be viewed at the Brewbook, which is a exclusive book for this new category of foods. 

Wooden Kegs and Preserves Jar only accepts specific ingredients such as Vegetables, Fruits, etc. Producing an invalid product will result in Wet Sludge. (Item equal to Wet Goop). Products inside them do not spoil.
